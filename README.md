# SPO_DEV
Repository for prerelease development builds of SPO

NOTE: These are unstable prerelease builds of SPO used for testing new additions and may result in profile corruption and/or Tarkov/SPT file damage. Use at your own risk

Since this is a testing branch for SPO, the main goal is to reduce as many problems as possible to get the build as stable as possible prior to public release, and an important part of making that possible is reporting bugs and issues when you encounter them. When you encounter a bug, consult the ReadBeforeBugReport.md before reporting bugs.

If you wish to stay up-to-date with information on SPO or wish to contribute in any way, then please join our Discord at https://discord.gg/Gd2xPpf
