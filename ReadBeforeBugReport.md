# Bug reports are crucial for fixing issues and ensuring SPO is as stable as possible prior to release
## If you encounter an issue, ensure that it meets the prerequisites listed below prior to submitting an issue report

1. The issue is 100% related to and caused by SPO
2. The issue can be consistently reproduced
3. The issue doesn't result from player changes to code (exluding configs)
4. Most importantly, **make sure the issue hasn't already been reported yet!**

#### If the issue meets the prerequistes listed above, then head to the "Issues" tab and create a new issue report. We value every report as they are ultimately for the betterment of the mod, however, there are still guidelines for posting issue reports, below are the guidelines for creating bug reports that you must follow (at least to a degree) if you want to avoid having your report closed

Guidelines:
- Include a descriptive name
- Give an accurate descriptive of the issue, its effects, and how to reproduce it
- Include the "errors", "backend", and "applications" logs from SPT's "logs" folders
- Give the issue report a good format (doesn't have to be beautiful, just readable)
- Keep the report as straight-forward as possible
- Don't report a bug that has already been reported _(this will pretty much guarantee that your issue will be closed)_

Not following at least _most_ of the listed guidelines may result in your issue report being closed without investigation
